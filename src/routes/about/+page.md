# Our Design Teams
We host several design teams in our organization that inform students on how to develop their music and audio devices during weekly meetings.

## Hardware
Our hardware team develops audio circuits for various devices such as guitar pedals, microphones, and synthesizers. We utilize LTspice for simulations and design PCBs on Altium.

## Music Production
Our music production team teaches students how to navigate Digital Audio Workstations in order to create their own music. We also dive into music theory and composition.

## Software
(on hiatus? maybe keep separate or add explainer that if interest we can make stuff)
