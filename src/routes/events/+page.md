Similarly to projects, I'll ideally have a card-type system where you can fill in some details and it'll have a consistent format across them.

Also ideally, a google calendar widget thing that reads some central AES calendar and then links to the cards (maybe further off, will have to think about how to implement that)

Where we can hype up gbms, concert, etc, and distribute flyers
