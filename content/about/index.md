## Audio Engineering Society at UF
The Audio Engineering Society at the University of Florida brings together students interested in audio hardware, signal processing, recording, and live sound. We build projects, host workshops, and run events. 

While we didn't choose the slogan, AES is referred to by almost the entire student body as the "coolest club on campus."
### What We do
Our organization consists of three main branches:

#### Design
Our design leads develop audio hardware and software including analog and digital synthesizers, guitar pedals, embedded instruments and sequencers, and speakers. We will soon be opening applications for roles on a series of new and exciting design projects so that students in ECE and beyond can get involved!

We host public design meetings in the Malachowsky Makerspace every Wednesday from 5:00pm to 7:00pm. We spend this time developing our projects and chatting with anyone that attends who is interested either in our current endeavours or in starting their own. 

#### Music Production
Music prod meetings, what goes on...

#### Social
Events, concerts, tech talks...

### Get Involved
If you're interested in hardware and software projects, feel free to attend our design meetings and ask us what we're working on. We can direct you to team applications, or help you if you have specific questions about your own projects. If you're interested in music production, be sure to attend those meetings or check out the relevant channels in our Discord server. Announcements about upcoming events are also posted there.
